Mannheim, a city with a rich history and a vibrant present, is the second-largest city in the German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.
Founded in 1607, it's known for its unique grid-like city layout, earning it the nickname "Quadratestadt" or "City of Squares."
The city's streets and avenues are laid out in a grid pattern, with squares numbered from A1 to U6 instead of traditional street names.
At the heart of this grid stands the Mannheim Palace, one of the largest Baroque palaces in the world, now housing the University of Mannheim.
This institution is often referred to as the "Harvard of Germany" for its excellence in business administration.
Mannheim is also a cultural hub, with a thriving arts and music scene, and is an important industrial and commercial city, playing a significant role in Germany's economy.
